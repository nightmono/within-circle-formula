# Within Circle Formula

Just testing a formula that determines if a point is within a circle. 

Backstory is I was working with points and circles and made this quick visualisation to test the formula.

## Instructions

Click to spawn a point.

Points can be dragged. *(May not work on mobile.)*

Yellow points are within the circle (according to the formula) and white otherwise.
